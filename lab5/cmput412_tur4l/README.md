# CMPUT 412, Tural Bakhtiyarli

Hello,

My name is Tural Bakhtiyarli, and I am a third year computing science major in the University of Alberta.The purpose of this repository is to share my codes for the lab assignments.You will find some general information about each lab during this README. You can also find more information by referring to https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/tur4l/home

## Lab 1: Basic Development on Duckiebot
In lab 1, you can find a template for a folder for working on your Duckiebot. You will also find some information in the README file about the template. For in depth report of the lab, please refer to: https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/tur4l/exercises/exercise-1

## Lab 2: ROS Development and Kinematics
In lab 2, we dive deeper into ROS. You can find some examples of using ROS nodes, topics, services, messages, and bags. You will also find codes for the odometry and kinematics of the duckiebot, and movement functions for differential drive for moving straight or turning in an angle.
