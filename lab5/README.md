The cmput412_tur4l repo's Lab5 digit_detection_node can be built with "dts devel build -f -H csc229XX" and run with "dts devel run -R csc229XX". The E5ML repo can be built with "dts devel build -f -H csc229XX" and run with "dts devel run -H csc229XX".

## Objective

The main purpose of this exercise was to implement neural network to create a module for digit detection on apriltags using the camera of our robots. We would also like to learn to run machine learning algorithm that handles the sensor input from robot from a remote laptop in real time, as this is a useful method to train/deploy an ML algorithm on a less powerful robot like the duckiebot.

The digit detection node should be run on a separate laptop using -R option before running lane following.
