### COMPUTER VISION FOR ROBOTICS

Author: Leen Alzebdeh and Tianming Han

Lane following could be run from E3P3Transform repo's lane following package, AprilTag detection could be run from AdvancedARExercise repo, localization using sensor fusion could be run from E3P3Transform. All can be built with "dts devel build -f -H csc229XX" and run with "dts devel run -H csc229XX"

## Objective

Our objective is to visualize robot transforms by using a fixed world frame and considering all other frames, including the robot frame, relative to it. We aim to improve localization of the robot in the environment by using static landmarks - AprilTags - in the environment. We also aim to incorporate computer vision for the robot to drive inside road lanes, and to detect the ID of each AprilTag it observes in the environment.
